## Background
- I'm a product manager that transitioned from being a software engineering several years ago
- Technologies for web app development have changed since then and I want to invest in learning more skills, methodologies, and standards
- I'm interested in exploring new software ideas and feel that becoming familiar with modern tech stacks and tooling will enable more efficiences for myself and others that I work with

## Goal
- I don't currently have a personal blog page and was considering a no-code tool like Webflow, that that isn't as fun as building something from scratch
- I was to be able to learn how to develop the client only using React and maintain the middle and backend with no or low-code platforms
